# Review Lessons Workflow

Process pending lesson submissions from downstream projects.

## Steps

1. **Invoke the `lessons-review` skill**

   This skill will:
   - Fetch open issues labeled `lesson-submission`
   - Present each with evaluation criteria
   - Guide Accept/Reject/Defer decisions
   - Handle issue closure and commits

See [lessons-review skill](file:///Users/ty/dev/personal/agentic-project-template/template/.agent/skills/lessons-review/SKILL.md) for full details.
